This course targets MSc and PhD students who work in quantitative genetics, and it aims at providing students with basic knowledge of scientific computing, and introducing Julia language and its use in genomic research. The course aligns with the another NADAS organized course: Statistical methods in animal breeding: With a focus on Genomic Selection and Genome-Wide Association Studies. Students who participates that course are encouraged to combine it with the Julia course. The dates of both courses were planned such that students have the opportunity to participate both courses' on-site sessions at Uppsala, from 16-18th February. The students are expected to participate in an open genomic-prediction tournament as the final assignment.
