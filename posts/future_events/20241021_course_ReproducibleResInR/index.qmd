The course will define reproducibility and explain why it is important in scientific practice, publication, and funding. It will introduce basic concepts and tools for ensuring reproducibility in data analysis using R while using public databases for data access and storage. Through presentations, exercises, and discussions participants will learn to increase the reproducibility of their research in the future.
