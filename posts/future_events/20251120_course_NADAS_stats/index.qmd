This course offers a focused introduction to genomic selection and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), combining online seminars with hands-on computational training. Participants will discuss key methods, explore current research applications, and gain practical experience through guided computer exercises.

The course will be held over three occassions (see details below): the first to instances will be online, while the hands-on part will be held in person in Uppsala, Sweden. If you wish to participate, send an email to lars.ronnegard@slu.se by the 17 th of November.
