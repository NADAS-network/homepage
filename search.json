    "text": "Our aim\nTechnological advances allowing for cost-effective and high-throughput genetic characterization, and for automated large-scale phenotyping, has brought animal and plant breeding into the so called “big-data” era. Big-data requires special processing pipelines and sophisticated statistical methods and analysis tools than those that have been traditionally employed.\nA number of independent projects at the Nordic institutes address these needs individually, but a collective effort at the region-level can help to increase the overall competitiveness, and to ensure the sustainability of Nordic agriculture. These efforts should include also a proper training of agricultural data scientists, which is becoming more evident in today’s data-driven agricultural systems.\nWe aim at:\n\nexchanging ideas and discussing state-of-the-art approaches for boosting data-driven breeding and farm management in the Nordic region,\npromoting sharing of data and analysis tools within the region, and\nproviding necessary training to young agricultural data scientist to ensure they possess the knowledge needed for securing long-term competitiveness of Nordic farming.\n\nOur network brings together the researchers and PhD students from Aarhus University, Agricultural University of Iceland, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources Institute of Finland, as well as industry stakeholders in the region.\n\n\nOur funding\nWe are funded by the The Nordic Joint Committee for Agricultural and Food Research.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent and future news and events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital meeting: Data Security, Handling & Storage in the Nordic Region\n\n\nMay 28th, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 6, 2025\n\n\nAmrei\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical methods in animal breeding\n\n\nWith a focus on Genomic Selection and Genome-Wide Association Studies\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 27, 2025\n\n\nAmrei\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

Key skills highlighted included genomics, genetics, statistics, complex modeling, and computational expertise, along with adaptability and a holistic approach to breeding programs.\nAfter the talks, we discussed how to better connect students with industry. While students look for collaborative thesis projects with the private sector, companies struggle to find them for relevant projects. Strengthening these connections will be a key focus moving forward.\nThank you everyone who joined us for an interesting meeting and discussions.\n\nProgram:\n\nWednesday February 5th, 2025\n\n\n\nTime\nTopic\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n\n10:00\nWelcome and Agenda\nEmre Karaman, QGG\n\n\n10:05\nEli Grindflek\nResearch Director at Norsvin\n\n\n10:25\nBjarne Nielsen\nAssoc Prof, QGG\n\n\n10:40\nPernille Merete Sarup\nGenomic Breeder, Nordic Seed\n\n\n11:00\nQ&A and Open discussion\n\n\n\n12:00\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Picture: Jón, chatGPT4.0)"

They will be introduced to R packages for genomic selection and GWAS. They will perform hands-on computer exercises using a subset of these R packages. Several papers on Genomic Selection and GWAS will be discussed. There will be a couple of presentations on advanced topics and in the final home assignment the students will participate in an open genomic-prediction tournament."
