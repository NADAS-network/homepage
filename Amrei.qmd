Biologist, bioinformatician and director of [SLU's bioinformatics infrastructure](https://www.slubi.se). 

I am a biologist turned bioinformatician, who likes programming, puzzle-solving, and teaching. I enjoy fostering connections between people and learning new things.  Outside of bioinformatics, I relax with strategic and abstract board games.
